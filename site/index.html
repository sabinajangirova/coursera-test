<div class="verse1">
I can't think of getting old
It only makes me want to die
And I can't think of who I was
'Cause it just makes me want to cry, cry, cry, cry
Can't look back, can't look too far ahead
I got the point, I got the message

</div>
<div class="verse2">
  I'm just a little bit caught in the middle
  I try to keep going but it's not that simple
  I think I'm a little bit caught in the middle
  Gotta keep going or they'll call me a quitter
  Yeah I'm caught in the middle
